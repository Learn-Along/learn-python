# Learn Python

This is a collection of tutorials to help you get upto speed to using python in production.

## Purpose

I created this collection in an attempt to teach a few of my buddies how to built python apps for production.
Forget the beginner tutorials that teach you how to create a todo list and all. In here you find solutions to actual problems python developers have to solve in the real world.

## Expectations

- New tutorials will be added whenever I encounter new issues in my normal software engineering work
- Some tutorials might be deleted if they become irrelevant at some point in time
- Tutorials can be updated by any well-wisher who might have spotted something. A simple pull request is enough.
- New ideas for new tutorials or for modification of current tutorials are welcome. Create an issue with a sufficient description. Someone can start with a 'How to Contribute' documentation issue.
