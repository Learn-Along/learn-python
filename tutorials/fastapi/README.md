# Fastapi Tutorials

This is a collection of tutorials that are linked to working with the [fastapi web framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

Fastapi is a really fast python framework that runs on the new and improved ASGI (older frameworks like django were originally built with WSGI in mind). It is so sweet to use. Its documentation is thorough. It encourages the use of type specification in python.

Other features include:

- Automated Swagger/ReDoc Documentation for the REST API
- Very fast running on uvicorn ASGI server
- Easy dependiency injection
- Automated serialization of responses
- Support for Jinja templates
- Support for Websockets
- Support for combining a number of separate fast api apps into one by mounting
- Declaration of routers by use of decorators

Some mention-worthy libraries used together with flask include:

- [Pydantic](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for the data validation
