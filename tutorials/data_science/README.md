# Data Science Tutorials

This is a collection of tutorials that are linked to working on data with python.

Some of the common things done on data using python include:

- Extraction of data from REST APIs programmatically e.g. using [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) or [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/)
- Web scraping web sites using libraries like [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/), [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and [beautiful soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- Connection to message brokers for example to receive data in realtime e.g. using [stomp.py](https://pypi.org/project/stomp.py/), [pika](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Serialization (python object to string) and Deserialization (string to python object) of JSON e.g. using [orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/)
- Deserialization of XML files and strings e.g. using [xml_stream](https://pypi.org/project/xml-stream/), [xmltodict](https://pypi.org/project/xmltodict/)
- Saving of large data for processing e.g. using [pyarrow](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow/), [diskcache](https://pypi.org/project/diskcache/)
- Manipulation of large datasets performantly e.g. [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [dask](https://dask.org/)
- Machine learning with [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [scikitlearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

Python has a huge ecosystem of libraries that are used for data science. Even big data frameworks like [Apache spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) have support for python
