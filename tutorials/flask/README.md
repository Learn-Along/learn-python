# Flask Tutorials

This is a collection of tutorials that are linked to working with the [flask microframework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

Flask is a python web framework that can be used to create REST APIs, websites (using jinja templates) etc.
Unlike its sister, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), it comes with only a few things included but the ecosystem of other supporting libraries is mature.

It comes with templating, security and creation of routers.
Some mention-worthy libraries used together with flask include:

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for the data layer
